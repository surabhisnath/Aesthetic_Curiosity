I used different methods of clearing the grid ,"I liked the symmetrical images the most. In fact, it surprised me how much more aesthetically pleasing I found them compared to the ones with random or asymmetrical patterns. It seemed like I almost got a little serotonin bump when the image was revealed. I also found an interesting frustration when a pattern looked to exist, but then found just a few regions were random. Initially, I felt a bit disappointed that the picture was messed up, but as time went on and I took note of the frustration, I had to laugh at myself for being upset by such a small thing. After that happened, I started to look at the pictures with the random regions differently, looking for smaller patterns within the whole or looking for an 'artistic' representation of what it might be, like cloud spotting. That made the whole thing more fun, and then I cleared all the grids completely after that, I believe.","The ones that looked like they were randomly composed with no symmetry, but only early on. As time went on, I cleared all of the grids.","Usually, I just moved on about 10 seconds or so after all the regions were cleared. If it was a grid with an intricate or assymetric pattern, I tried to view it for a while to see different things. In those instances, I was just careful not to be near the 1 minute mark to get timed out.",1,8,9,"This ended up being more fun than I thought. I would have liked a timer on the screen or a warning system for being timed out as it was a good bit of clicking, and that might have made it easier to develop a comfortable pace.",43.55
